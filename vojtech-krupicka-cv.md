## Experience

### Seznam.cz a.s., Brno, Czech Republic — *Software Engineer Mapy.cz / Mapy.com* — Dec 2012 – Aug 2026

**User Media Platform — Solo Developer (2018 – 2026)**

- Inherited, rewrote, and optimized the media backend service for storing, handling, and serving Mapy.com's geo-referenced media to web and mobile apps — migrated largely solo from Python2/RPC to a Python3/Flask/Pydantic architecture, using PostgreSQL/CDN for storing 20M+ media files and metadata and handling hundreds of requests/second (with response times reduced from 300ms to 50ms through the rewrite for key endpoints) (2019 – 2026)
- Integrated ML-based (neural networks) automatic photo validation/moderation using TensorFlow, ONNX, PyTorch, NumPy, and scikit-image (2018 – 2026)
- Collaborated on continuous migration of media metadata from other Seznam.cz's services to Mapy.com's media infrastructure using Kafka messaging (2025 – 2026)

**Panorama Imaging System (2014 – 2018)**

- Contributed to the development of software for the Panorama Car with a custom-made camera rig, including the panorama photography processing pipeline and the car-crew tablet application, used to navigate the planned route and operate the camera rig from the car seat
- Co-rewrote (2017, 2-person team) most of the panorama photography pipeline to suit a new data supplier, processing terabytes of imagery data
- Built first version of the panorama-photography serving platform (2014)

**Geospatial Data Processing — DEMs, Elevation & Contours (2015 – 2019)**

- Processed global digital elevation models (DEMs, 200GB+ source data), wrote scripts for generating better-looking hillshades and smoothed contour lines
- Built a pipeline generating and storing 15M+ contour lines (1.5TB) across the globe using GDAL, OGR, and PostGIS
- Built a backend service for on-demand computing of elevation profiles across multi-point routes from multiple DEM sources
- Collaborated with the Teiresias Centre (Masaryk University) on Mapnik styles and street abbreviations for tactile maps (Haptické Mapy)

**Internal Tools & Emerging Tech**

- Built a pipeline for automated text translations from multiple sources via AI/LLM models (2025 – 2026)
- Built a Kafka consumer pipeline for transactional email notifications (2025)
- Solo developer and maintainer of the Mapy.com bug tracking system using external MantisBT as a bug tracker — built new plugins (PHP Full-stack) and components (Python, PostgreSQL) connecting Mapy.com/Seznam.cz frontends with MantisBT for helpdesk-to-end-user feedback loops; migrated old MantisBT 1.3 to 2.x and MySQL to PostgreSQL (2014 – 2026)
- Contributed to the distributed rendering system of map tiles from multiple data sources (PostgreSQL, shapefiles, DEMs, mapnik styles) with distribution of final data (500GB+ per version) to production servers (2013); then co-rewrote it in 2017 (as a part of 4-person team), which reduced map tiles update time from weeks to days

**DevOps & Methodologies**

- Formerly used Debian packages for deploying components to production; later moved to deploying Docker images to Kubernetes via CI pipelines (GitLab CI, Jenkins) across dev/staging/production environments and using Prometheus monitoring with Grafana dashboards
- Using Agile & Scrum/Kanban for planning (YouTrack, Trello)

### Prezentuji.cz, Brno, Czech Republic — *Full-stack Web Developer / Smartsupp Co-Founder* — 2011 – Nov 2012

- Built tailor-made web applications (e-shops, blogs, presentation sites) and converted Photoshop designs into HTML/CSS templates (using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) (2011 – mid-2012)
- Co-founded Smartsupp, an early-stage startup building embeded live web instant-messaging software for website owners and support staff (a concept rare in 2012, now an industry standard), co-created the architecture for the first version of the system; contributed mainly to backend/server-side development in C++, including client/server communication (June – Nov 2012)

### Symedia s.r.o., Hlinsko, Czech Republic — *Full-stack Web Developer* — 2009 – 2011

- Joined as part of the founding team building Sportisimo.cz's e-commerce platform from scratch (Symedia was later acquired by Sportisimo — a major Czech sports retailer); contributed as a Full-stack developer across PHP, MySQL, JavaScript (jQuery), HTML, and CSS
- Designed and built a custom CMS used by Sportisimo staff to create the e-shop's public-facing pages, including custom widgets (galleries, carousels, polls, menus, and more) for brand and product content — the system remained in production for nearly a decade
